# debian-bullseye-zfs-root
Installs Debian GNU/Linux 11 Bullseye to a native ZFS root filesystem using a [Debian Live CD](https://www.debian.org/CD/live/). The resulting system is a fully updateable debian system with no quirks or workarounds.

# Usage

1. Boot [Debian Live CD](https://www.debian.org/CD/live/)
1. Login (user: `user`, password: `live`) and become root
1. Setup network and export `http_proxy` environment variable (if needed)
1. Run [this script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hn/debian-buster-zfs-root/master/debian-buster-zfs-root.sh)
1. User interface: Select disks and RAID level
1. User interface: Decide if you want Legacy BIOS or EFI boot (only if your hardware supports EFI)
1. Let the installer do the work
1. User interface: install grub to *all* disks participating in the array (only if you're using Legacy BIOS boot)
1. User interface: enter root password and select timezone
1. Reboot
1. Star [this repository](https://github.com/hn/debian-buster-zfs-root) :)

## Fixes included

* Some mountpoints, notably `/var`, need to be mounted via fstab as the ZFS mount script runs too late during boot.
* The EFI System Partition (ESP) is a single point of failure on one disk, [this is arguably a mis-design in the UEFI specification](https://wiki.debian.org/UEFI#RAID_for_the_EFI_System_Partition). This script installs an ESP partition to every RAID disk, accompanied with a corresponding EFI boot menu.

## Bugs

* `grub-install` sometimes mysteriously fails for disk numbers >= 4 (`grub-install: error: cannot find a GRUB drive for /dev/disk/by-id/...`).
